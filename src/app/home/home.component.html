            <h2> Craft Beer Industry Market Segments </h2>
            <p>  The Brewers Association defines a craft brewer as a small and independent brewer.
                There are six distinct craft beer industry market segments: microbreweries, brewpubs, taproom breweries, regional breweries, contract brewing companies, and alternating proprietors.
